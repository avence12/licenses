Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\r\nnon-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n  a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a\r\n  collective work;\r\n\r\n  b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original\r\n  Work, thereby creating derivative works (\"Derivative Works\") based upon the\r\n  Original Work;\r\n\r\n  c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative\r\n  Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or\r\n  Derivative Works that You distribute or communicate shall be licensed under\r\n  this Open Software License;\r\n\r\n  d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\r\n\r\n  e) to display the Original Work publicly.\r\n\r\n2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty- free,\r\nnon-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled\r\nby the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the\r\nLicensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,\r\nhave made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.\r\n\r\n3) Grant of Source Code License. The term \"Source Code\" means the preferred\r\nform of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available\r\ndocumentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to\r\nprovide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along\r\nwith each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor\r\nreserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable\r\ncopy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to\r\npermit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor\r\ncontinues to distribute the Original Work.\r\n\r\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names\r\nof any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or\r\nservice marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\r\nOriginal Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as\r\nexpressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to\r\nLicensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other\r\nintellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer\r\nfor sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the\r\nlicensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks\r\nof Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in\r\nthis License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under\r\nterms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise\r\nwould have a right to license.\r\n\r\n5) External Deployment. The term \"External Deployment\" means the use,\r\ndistribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any\r\nway such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone\r\nother than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those\r\npersons or made available as an application intended for use over a network.\r\nAs an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat\r\nany External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a\r\ndistribution under section 1(c).\r\n\r\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative\r\nWorks that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the\r\nSource Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any\r\ndescriptive text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause\r\nthe Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent\r\nAttribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have\r\nmodified the Original Work.\r\n\r\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that\r\nthe copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein\r\nby Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the\r\nterms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those\r\ncopyrights and patent rights.

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,\r\nwhether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the\r\nLicensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or\r\nconsequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or\r\nthe use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss\r\nof goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\nother commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not\r\napply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\r\n\r\n9) Acceptance and Termination.

Any use of the Original\r\nWork outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be\r\nsubject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the\r\nappropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n12) Attorneys' Fees.

This section shall survive the termination of this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be\r\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary\r\nto make it enforceable.\r\n\r\n14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this License,\r\nwhether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity\r\nexercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License.\r\nFor legal entities, \"You\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by,\r\nor is under common control with you.
